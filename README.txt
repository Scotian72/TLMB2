## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

These fixes address training camp setup and scheduling. Still needed for full gameplay:

**Future Development:**
1. Regular season game simulation (games scheduled but need sim code)
2. Player stats accumulation over season
3. Standings updates after games
4. Weekly training plans
5. Save/Load system
6. Tournament simulation
7. Playoff simulation

**But:** Training camp is now fully functional and engaging!

---

## 📖 GAMEPLAY TIPS

### Training Camp Strategy

**Day 1-7:** Focus on development
- Each day's clinic focus is random (shooting, passing, defense, etc.)
- Players with high work ethic improve more
- U9 players get larger gains (fundamentals)
- Scrimmage results affect morale

**Morale Management:**
- Winners gain morale (happier)
- Losers lose morale (need encouragement)
- High morale = better performance
- Low morale = worse performance

**Team Assignment (Day 7):**
- Assign best players to A team
- Balanced roster for B team
- Consider chemistry and positions
- Don't forget goalies!

### Regular Season Prep

**After Training Camp:**
1. Set lines (use quick button!)
2. Review schedule (48 games)
3. Check standings page (ready for results)
4. View opponent rosters (scout the competition)
