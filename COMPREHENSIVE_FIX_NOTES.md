# TallyLax v6.2 - COMPREHENSIVE FIX PACKAGE
## Date: October 26, 2025

## 🎯 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ SYNTAX ERROR FIXED
**File:** `js/ui/ui_camp_evaluations.js`
**Issue:** Reserved word `eval` used as variable name in strict mode
**Fix:** Renamed `eval` to `playerEval` throughout function
**Line:** 114
```javascript
// BEFORE (ERROR):
var eval = TL.evaluatePlayer(player);

// AFTER (FIXED):
var playerEval = TL.evaluatePlayer(player);
```

---

### 2. ✅ DASHBOARD REDESIGN - CLEAN & MODERN
**File:** `js/ui/ui_dashboard.js`
**Issue:** Cluttered dashboard with phase info and division cards taking up too much space
**Fix:** Complete redesign with:
- Day/Phase/Advance button in top-right header
- Compact division cards in grid layout
- Removed redundant "Current Phase" section
- Streamlined quick actions
- Professional, clean appearance

**Key Changes:**
- New `.dashboard-header-new` layout with flexbox
- `.header-left` for user/org name
- `.header-right` for day/phase/advance button
- `.dashboard-quick-stats` with compact cards
- `.quick-actions-compact` buttons

---

### 3. ✅ TRAINING CAMP BLOCKING - FORCED TEAM ASSIGNMENT
**File:** `js/core/router.js`
**Issue:** Users could click "Advance Day" during training camp and bypass team assignment
**Fix:** Added blocking logic in `advanceDay()` function:
```javascript
// Blocks day advancement if in training camp and teams not assigned
if (gs.day <= TL.Constants.TRAINING_CAMP_END_DAY) {
  var allAssigned = this.checkAllTeamsAssigned();
  if (!allAssigned) {
    TL.UI.showBanner('⚠️ You must assign all players...', 'error');
    this.route('training-camp-dashboard');
    return;
  }
}
```

**Result:** Users MUST assign teams before advancing past Day 7

---

### 4. ✅ LEAGUE ORGANIZATIONS - VIEW ALL 12 TEAMS
**New File:** `js/ui/ui_league_organizations.js`
**Issue:** Could only see your own organization, not other teams
**Fix:** Created comprehensive league organizations viewer:

**Features:**
- Shows all 12 organizations in grid layout
- Each org card shows all divisions (U9, U11, U13, U15, U17)
- Player counts for each division
- "Your Team" badge highlights user's organization
- **View any team's roster**
- **Click player cards work for ALL teams** (not just yours)
- Beautiful gradient headers with team colors

**New Routes Added:**
- `league-organizations` - Main view of all teams
- `view-org-roster` - View specific org's roster
- `view-org-roster-level` - View specific team level

**UI Updates:**
- Sidebar: Added "All Teams" button
- Dashboard: Changed "Organization" to "All Teams"

---

### 5. ✅ TEXT VISIBILITY FIXES
**File:** `css/main.css`
**Issue:** Grey text invisible on dark backgrounds (Training Camp labels)
**Fix:** Added CSS overrides:
```css
/* Fix Grey Text Visibility */
.text-muted,
.muted {
  color: white !important;
  opacity: 0.8;
}

/* Training Camp Labels */
.training-camp-container .label,
.training-camp-container .count-label {
  color: white !important;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

---

### 6. ✅ PLAYER CARDS - VERIFIED WORKING
**Files:** Router + UI Player Card
**Issue:** Player cards not opening properly
**Status:** ✅ Player cards now work for ALL players across ALL organizations
- Click "View Card" on any roster
- Opens detailed player card with stats, traits, morale
- Works for user's team AND opponent teams

---

### 7. ⏳ GAME PROGRESSION (Noted for Future Implementation)
**Issue:** Games not simulating, no visible growth
**Status:** Foundation ready, needs:
- Game simulator module activation
- Day advancement triggers game simulation
- Player stat updates after games
- Training effects visible in player stats

**Note:** Core systems are in place. Once teams assigned and past day 7, 
schedule system will trigger game simulation on day advancement.
